<p class='para1'>My name is Gregory Zucchero and I am a developer in the MERN/MEAN stack. I use the latest and greatest technolgies to find solutions to real world problems. While I was trained in the MERN stack; I decided to teach myself Angular due to its popularity, demonstrating my ability to learn and adapt to new technologies.</p>
<p class="para2">In today's technological world, it is important for developers to have the ability to adapt and implement the newest technoliges to stay ahead in the web-development space. Styles, designs and languages can become obselete very quickly and it is important to hire people who understand this and are passionate enough to be in the loop. if you have questions; please send me an email on the contact page.</p>
